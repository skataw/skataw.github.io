 ================== CAN MACHINES BE CREATIVE? ================== 

We naturally admire our Einsteins and Beethovens, and wonder if 
computers ever could create such wondrous theories or symphonies.  Most 
people think that creativity requires some special, magical  "gift" that 
simply cannot be explained. If so, then no computer could create - since  
anything machines can do (most people think can be explained.

To see what's wrong with that, we must avoid one naive trap. We mustn't 
only look at works our culture views as very great, until we first get good 
ideas about how ordinary people do ordinary things. We can't expect to 
guess, right off, how great composers write great symphonies. I don't 
believe that there's much difference between ordinary thought and 
highly creative thought. I don't blame anyone for not being able to do 
everything the most creative people do. I don't blame them for not being 
able to explain it, either. I do object to the idea that, just because we can't 
explain it now, then no one ever could imagine how creativity works.

We shouldn't intimidate ourselves by our admiration of our Beethovens 
and Einsteins. Instead, we ought to be annoyed by our ignorance of how 
we get ideas - and not just our "creative" ones. Were so accustomed to the 
marvels of the unusual that we forget how little we know about the 
marvels of ordinary thinking. Perhaps our superstitions about creativity 
serve some other needs, such as supplying us with heroes with such 
special qualities that, somehow, our deficiencies seem more excusable.

Do outstanding minds differ from ordinary minds in any special way? I 
don't believe that there is anything basically different in a genius, except 
for having an unusual combination of abilities, none very special by 
itself. There must be some intense concern with some subject, but that's 
common enough. There also must be great proficiency in that subject; 
this, too, is not so rare; we call it craftsmanship. There has to be enough 
self-confidence to stand against the scorn of peers; alone, we call that 
stubbornness. And certainly, there must be common sense. As I see it, any 
ordinary person who can understand an ordinary conversation has 
already in his head most of what our heroes have. So, why can't 
"ordinary, common sense" - when better balanced and more fiercely 
motivated - make anyone a genius,

So still we have to ask, why doesn't everyone acquire such a combination? 
First, of course, it sometimes just the accident of finding a novel way to 
look at things. But, then, there may be certain kinds of difference-in-
degree. One is in how such people learn to manage what they learn: 
beneath the surface of their mastery, creative people must have 
unconscious administrative skills that knit the many things they know 
together. The other difference is in why some people learn so many more 
and better skills. A good composer masters many skills of phrase and 
theme - but so does anyone who talks coherently.

Why do some people learn so much so well? The simplest hypothesis is 
that they've come across some better ways to learn! Perhaps such "gifts" 
are little more than tricks of "higher-order" expertise. Just as one child 
learns to re-arrange its building-blocks in clever ways, another child 
might learn to play, inside its head, at Fe-arranging how it learns!

 Our cultures don't encourage us to think much about learning. Instead 
we regard it as something that just happens to us. But learning must itself 
consist of sets of skills we grow ourselves; we start with only some of them 
and and slowly grow the rest. Why don't more people keep on learning 
more and better learning skills? Because it's not rewarded right away, its 
payoff has a long delay. When children play with pails and sand, they're 
usually concerned with goals like filling pails with sand. But once a child 
concerns itself instead with how to better learn, then that might lead to 
exponential learning growth! Each better way to learn to learn would lead 
to better ways to learn - and this could magnify itself into an awesome, 
qualitative change. Thus, first-rank "creativity" could be just the 
consequence of little childhood accidents.

So why is genius so rare, if each has almost all it takes? Perhaps because 
our evolution works with mindless disrespect for individuals. I'm sure no 
culture could survive, where everyone finds different ways to think. If 
so, how sad, for that means genes for genius would need, instead of 
nurturing, a frequent weeding out.
